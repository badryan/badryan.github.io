I presented at two past [Raspberry Jams](http://raspberryjam.org.uk/what-is-raspberryjam/) in Cambridge.


Blog posts mentioning my wireless sensors that I showed off at the Jam in July at Cambridge Consultants are here:

from [Recantha](http://www.recantha.co.uk/blog/?p=5242) (featuring a really angry looking Boris)

A radio interview with me and my son Finn that happened at the Jam in May in the CMS is here: [Cambridge 105 Gadget Guide](http://cambridge105.fm/podcasts/gadget-guide-31-05-2013/).
