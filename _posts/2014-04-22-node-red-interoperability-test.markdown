After a few months of working with [Node-RED](http://nodered.org), I thought it was about time to give something back to a great community. I decided to document my search for a good Internet-of-things platform on the web and the steps I had to take to make **Node-RED** talk to them.

Please find my white paper “*Data Storage & Visualisation in the Internet of Things*” (for download on [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/BorisAdryan/node-red-iotplatformtest)), in which I show code examples how to connect Node-RED with minimal efforts, provide an overview of limitations I encountered, and offer a few subtle recommendations which platform might be best for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your</span> job.

Platforms that were included in the test: **Carriots**, **EmonCMS**, **Evrythng**, **Eyehub**, **Exosite**, **Geras**, **OpenSensors.IO**, **Tinamous**, **Thingspeak**, **Ubidots**, **Xively**.
