Last Tuesday saw another special event as part of the [IoT London Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/iotlondon/) series, when our host and organiser [Alex Deschamps-Sonsino](https://twitter.com/iotwatch) invited us to the City Hall.<br>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our poshest host yet! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iotlondon?src=hash">#iotlondon</a> <a href="https://t.co/Y3vrRVwzuW">pic.twitter.com/Y3vrRVwzuW</a></p>&mdash; London IOT Meetup (@iotlondon) <a href="https://twitter.com/iotlondon/status/656512655394516993">October 20, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
The focus of this meeting was **a showcase of local IoT innovation**, and with London being one of the hotbeds for the Internet of Things in Europe (if not in the world), I had great expectations. The event had been paraphrased *The (Connected) Living Room* because of the name of the venue (aka [London's Living Room at City Hall](http://www.londonslivingroom.co.uk)), and somehow I had envisioned **creative, innovative and compelling examples of consumer products** for our connected future.


Unfortunately, my main comment remained: **This is not the Internet of Things.**

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="und" dir="ltr">FYI <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IoT?src=hash">#IoT</a> <a href="http://t.co/Ll6iJyXXIV">pic.twitter.com/Ll6iJyXXIV</a></p>&mdash; Kevin Ashton (@Kevin_Ashton) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kevin_Ashton/status/645193490641477632">September 19, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Both Alex and I have voiced our opinions about what an IoT product constitutes,
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/iotwatch">@iotwatch</a> Your overview inspired me to this table that I frequently use to explain why software dev for IoT is hard. <a href="http://t.co/7zNA2t67UG">pic.twitter.com/7zNA2t67UG</a></p>&mdash; Boris Adryan (@BorisAdryan) <a href="https://twitter.com/BorisAdryan/status/635719128339320832">August 24, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
and simply [putting a chip in it](http://weputachipinit.tumblr.com) doesn't quite cut the mustard for qualifying as intelligent consumer IoT.<br><br>

The list of exhibitors and their products shocked me. There were no 'new kids on the block', no 'unexpected surprises', and many of those who exhibited weren't even IoT. Now, **I don't blame Alex and I'm aware she's working very hard behind the scenes to make events like this happen**. But there seems to be a blatant **lack of novelty in the field** and I wonder why that is. I feel like I'm heading straight into the [trough of disillusionment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle).<br>

Don't get me wrong, these are all very fine products and even though I classify many of them as "not IoT", I do own and love them. However, I'm still totally underwhelmed about the lack of true novelty and inspiration and appropriate utilisation of Internet-connectivity I expected from our local community.

Footnotes for the picture:

1. Most products in this category connect via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to a specific phone app. I grant the inventors, designers and engineers that -in theory- from there you can transmit to anywhere in the world. But with the exception of the BlueMaestro [Tempo Anywhere](http://bluemaestro.com/tempo-anywhere-internet-sensor-gateway/) that can serve as a hub device, none of these products are truly internet-integrated without the phone. In a way, BlueMaestro's [Pacif-i](http://bluemaestro.com/pacifi-smart-pacifier/) and BleepBleeps' [Tony Tempa](http://bleepbleeps.com/pages/tony-tempa-ear-thermometer) are smart products, but no more IoT than the Philips Shaver in Kevin Ashton's tweet. Still, I recommend everyone to have a look at these products. They're lovely.
2. I'd give these products the **IoT badge**, although with the exception of a vague mention on the Internet that [Trackener](http://www.trackener.com) provides an [API endpoint](http://www.hackathon.io/trackener), none of them get a gold star for the lack of openness. (But I stand corrected if I didn't research correctly here.)
3. The [SamLabs](https://samlabs.me) electronics kits give you all the tools you'd need to create an Internet-connected device. The more expensive hardware packs seem based around a 'cloud module' which suggests true IoT potential. However, I'd be careful building a product around these experiments, as we've seen with the sudden [disappearance of the Berg Cloud](http://blog.bergcloud.com/2014/09/09/week-483/) last year.
4. The [Flood Network](http://oxfloodnet.co.uk) have grown from a hobby project into a small commercial entity. Their place is in the smart city arena, and while you might potentially want to detect water levels in your basement, I'd classify their product as machine-to-machine application and not consumer IoT.

##Where from here?
Good question. I want to be inspired, for lack of my own imagination. I like to think about a future of assisted living, "enchanted objects" and continuous data integration for good. For convenience. For energy efficiency. And while we are already proactively thinking about the [measures that should be taken to protect our privacy](https://iot.ghost.io/connected-product-labelling/), at this stage I'd volunteer all my data if only those vague product ideas that we desire would actually materialise. **Product designers aren't stupid.** But creating a connected product that makes sense seems infinitely hard. What are the hurdles? Can we not innovate because it's *impossible to operate connected products without power*? Can we not invent because *connectivity is expensive*? Or have we just *not yet come up with the really clever ideas*? **After all, it took decades between having the Internet, and social media becoming totally ubiquitous.**
