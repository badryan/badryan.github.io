A few people who come to this blog know that I've been commercially active with **thingslearn Ltd.** in the UK. The company served as a port-of-call for customers mostly in the **IoT and M2M** arena, who were interested in the expert **data science** and **machine learning** capability that my research group at the University of Cambridge had built up. I wrote before on my soon defunct academic group pages what IoT has to do with systems biology. A lot. In brief, complex biological systems share many properties with **complex processes between interconnected technical systems**. On the abstraction level required for data science, the methods are identical. For a brief overview of the range of methods and tools we've developed, see:

Over the summer I've relocated to Germany, and joined [**Zühlke Engineering GmbH**](http://www.zuehlke.com) in Eschborn near Frankfurt. Working with Zühlke is a great opportunity to leverage the exposure of a company that's established and well-known in the European enterprise IT and industrial hard- and software solution market. What does this mean in practise?

* First and foremost: I can focus on the conversation between us -as solution providers- and customers who already know that they're going to get a technically excellent solution. (Establishing that convo takes a lot more legwork if you're a one-man show, and was just a waste of my time.)
* My skills are going to see a lot more use in a much wider area than I could have attracted as thingslearn Ltd. For obvious reasons I can't be more specific, but in the first two weeks at Zühlke I have gained more insight into novel and exciting use cases of IoT analytics than in the previous two years doing thingslearn.

**In conclusion:**
If you, dear reader, are interested in an IoT/M2M solution and/or require consulting in any part of the IoT stack, including analytics, **with Zühlke you've got a partner with a proven track record**. And yes, you can ask for me specifically. That's an option. You can reach me on boris.adryan AT zuehlke.com.
