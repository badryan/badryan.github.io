    <p>Last Tuesday saw another special event as part of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/iotlondon/">IoT London Meetup</a> series, when our host and organiser <a href="https://twitter.com/iotwatch">Alex Deschamps-Sonsino</a> invited us to the City Hall.<br /></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our poshest host yet! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iotlondon?src=hash">#iotlondon</a> <a href="https://t.co/Y3vrRVwzuW">pic.twitter.com/Y3vrRVwzuW</a></p>&mdash; London IOT Meetup (@iotlondon) <a href="https://twitter.com/iotlondon/status/656512655394516993">October 20, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The focus of this meeting was <strong>a showcase of local IoT innovation</strong>, and with London being one of the hotbeds for the Internet of Things in Europe (if not in the world), I had great expectations. The event had been paraphrased <em>The (Connected) Living Room</em> because of the name of the venue (aka <a href="*http://www.londonslivingroom.co.uk">London’s Living Room at City Hall</a>), and somehow I had envisioned <strong>creative, innovative and compelling examples of consumer products</strong> for our connected future.
<br />
Unfortunately, my main comment remained: <strong>This is not the Internet of Things.</strong></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="und" dir="ltr">FYI <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IoT?src=hash">#IoT</a> <a href="http://t.co/Ll6iJyXXIV">pic.twitter.com/Ll6iJyXXIV</a></p>&mdash; Kevin Ashton (@Kevin_Ashton) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kevin_Ashton/status/645193490641477632">September 19, 2015</a></blockquote>

Both Alex and I have voiced our opinions about what an IoT product constitutes,</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/iotwatch">@iotwatch</a> Your overview inspired me to this table that I frequently use to explain why software dev for IoT is hard. <a href="http://t.co/7zNA2t67UG">pic.twitter.com/7zNA2t67UG</a></p>&mdash; Boris Adryan (@BorisAdryan) <a href="https://twitter.com/BorisAdryan/status/635719128339320832">August 24, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>and simply <a href="http://weputachipinit.tumblr.com">putting a chip in it</a> doesn’t quite cut the mustard for qualifying as intelligent consumer IoT.<br /><br /></p>

<p>The list of exhibitors and their products shocked me. There were no ‘new kids on the block’, no ‘unexpected surprises’, and many of those who exhibited weren’t even IoT. Now, <strong>I don’t blame Alex and I’m aware she’s working very hard behind the scenes to make events like this happen</strong>. But there seems to be a blatant <strong>lack of novelty in the field</strong> and I wonder why that is. I feel like I’m heading straight into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle">trough of disillusionment</a>.<br />
<img src="/content/images/2015/10/exhibitors.jpg" alt="" />
<br />
Don’t get me wrong, these are all very fine products and even though I classify many of them as “not IoT”, I do own and love them. However, I’m still totally underwhelmed about the lack of true novelty and inspiration and appropriate utilisation of Internet-connectivity I expected from our local community.</p>

<p>Footnotes for the picture:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Most products in this category connect via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to a specific phone app. I grant the inventors, designers and engineers that -in theory- from there you can transmit to anywhere in the world. But with the exception of the BlueMaestro <a href="http://bluemaestro.com/tempo-anywhere-internet-sensor-gateway/">Tempo Anywhere</a> that can serve as a hub device, none of these products are truly internet-integrated without the phone. In a way, BlueMaestro’s <a href="http://bluemaestro.com/pacifi-smart-pacifier/">Pacif-i</a> and BleepBleeps’ <a href="http://bleepbleeps.com/pages/tony-tempa-ear-thermometer">Tony Tempa</a> are smart products, but no more IoT than the Philips Shaver in Kevin Ashton’s tweet. Still, I recommend everyone to have a look at these products. They’re lovely.</li>
  <li>I’d give these products the <strong>IoT badge</strong>, although with the exception of a vague mention on the Internet that <a href="http://www.trackener.com">Trackener</a> provides an <a href="http://www.hackathon.io/trackener">API endpoint</a>, none of them get a gold star for the lack of openness. (But I stand corrected if I didn’t research correctly here.)</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://samlabs.me">SamLabs</a> electronics kits give you all the tools you’d need to create an Internet-connected device. The more expensive hardware packs seem based around a ‘cloud module’ which suggests true IoT potential. However, I’d be careful building a product around these experiments, as we’ve seen with the sudden <a href="http://blog.bergcloud.com/2014/09/09/week-483/">disappearance of the Berg Cloud</a> last year.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://oxfloodnet.co.uk">Flood Network</a> have grown from a hobby project into a small commercial entity. Their place is in the smart city arena, and while you might potentially want to detect water levels in your basement, I’d classify their product as machine-to-machine application and not consumer IoT.</li>
</ol>

<p>##Where from here?
Good question. I want to be inspired, for lack of my own imagination. I like to think about a future of assisted living, “enchanted objects” and continuous data integration for good. For convenience. For energy efficiency. And while we are already proactively thinking about the <a href="https://iot.ghost.io/connected-product-labelling/">measures that should be taken to protect our privacy</a>, at this stage I’d volunteer all my data if only those vague product ideas that we desire would actually materialise. <strong>Product designers aren’t stupid.</strong> But creating a connected product that makes sense seems infinitely hard. What are the hurdles? Can we not innovate because it’s <em>impossible to operate connected products without power</em>? Can we not invent because <em>connectivity is expensive</em>? Or have we just <em>not yet come up with the really clever ideas</em>? <strong>After all, it took decades between having the Internet, and social media becoming totally ubiquitous.</strong></p>
